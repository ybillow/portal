       <p>Hi. I am an upcoming Full Stack developer based in Seattle, WA. I have a strong passion for web development and went down this path to become a beacon of hope for my younger siblings as well as my community. I loved playing with computers since I was a kid and I'm hoping to reach my goals one day.</p>
       
       <p>A little more about me; I enjoy outdoor activities as it keeps me physically active and fit. I enjoy hiking, swimming, and travelling. I am huge sports fan across all the different dimensions it offers. The NBA, NFL, and Soccer. Mostly European soccer or 'football' as that's the right term.</p>
       
       <p>I have attached a few projects I made. I am still learning and polishing my skills as I believe that knowledge is key.</p>
        
       <h3><strong>Education & Skills</strong></h3>
        
       <p>I attended Saint Cloud State University in Minnesota and gained my AA in Health Sciences. I was unable to finish my bachelor's due to family reasons however, I plan on going back and finishing my degree</p>
       
       <p>I currently attend Seattle Central College where I am apart of a workforce training program called Year Up. It's a program that has a mission of closing the opportunity divide in the industry by providing the youth with the skills and experience needed to succeed.</p>
      
       <p>I plan on getting a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering post Year Up, and combine that with my technical skills. I hope to one day land a job at NASA.</p>
           
      <p>I am proficient in using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also in the middle of earning a Google IT Automation with Python certificate. </p>
